      body: "## New in 2.7.2\n\n### Kubernetes 1.25 and PSAs\n\n- Kubernetes 1.25 GA takes PSAs (Pod Security Admissions) out of beta. PSAs replace the former PSP (Pod Security Policy) setup, which is a major change that impacts upgrades of Kubernetes. \n\n## New in 2.7.1\n\n- This was a security release to address a few CVEs and other bugs. Please see https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.7.1 for the full list of what was addressed. \n\n## New in 2.7.0\n\n### k3s provisioning is GA (x86 Only)\n\n- Provisioning K3s clusters on x86 clusters has graduated to GA! The fully compliant Kubernetes distribution is simplified, secure and at less than 60mb is perfect for Edge.\n\n### Rancher Extensions\n\n- Rancher Extensions provides a mechanism to extend the functionality of the Rancher Manager UI. Rancher will use this to provide new functionality that can be\ninstalled by administrators. Extensions are provided as Helm charts. A new top-level 'Extensions' UI allows administrators to enable Extensions support and install and manage Extensions themselves.\n\n### OCI Support for Helm for Fleet\n\n- Authentication for OCI-based registries is now supported. Note that the structure of the fleet.yaml is the same and the credentials are provided as a Kubernetes secret, which is described in the Private Helm Repo box in the Repo Structure docs.\n\n",
